        "answer": "The equivalent weight of an acid is determined by dividing the molecular weight of the acid by the number of hydrogen ions (protons) it can donate.

Understanding both is important because molarity changes with temperature due to volume changes, while molality remains constant as it depends on mass. This knowledge is crucial for precise calculations in experiments where temperature fluctuations occur."

In redox titrations, normality accounts for the number of electrons transferred per reaction, which is essential for determining the reactive capacity of a solution, unlike molarity that only reflects concentration."

This principle is crucial for accurate titration results as it allows the calculation of the concentration of unknown solutions. The normality equation, which relates normality to equivalents and volume, helps in determining these concentrations precisely."

As the titration progresses, KMnO<sub>4</sub> reduces to the colorless Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion. The endpoint is reached when a slight excess of KMnO<sub>4</sub> remains, imparting a faint pink color to the solution, signaling the completion of the reaction."
