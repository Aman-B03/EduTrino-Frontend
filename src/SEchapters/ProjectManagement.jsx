Techniques like PERT and CPM break down complex tasks into manageable activities, making it easier to track progress, allocate resources, and identify potential risks.<br><br><b>1. Planning:</b> Organizing tasks helps in clear goal setting, providing a roadmap for project execution. This reduces uncertainties and sets expectations for all team members.<br><b>2. Resource Management:</b> Allocates resources efficiently by ensuring that human resources, finances, and materials are used optimally, preventing overuse or underutilization.<br><b>3. Risk Management:</b> Identifies risks early by conducting risk assessments throughout the project, allowing teams to prepare contingency plans and avoid project delays.<br><b>4. Time Efficiency:</b> Tracks deadlines with better control by breaking the project into smaller tasks, ensuring each milestone is achieved in time.<br><b>5. Cost Management:</b> Reduces the risk of budget overruns by maintaining a clear view of expenditures and avoiding unnecessary costs through constant monitoring."
