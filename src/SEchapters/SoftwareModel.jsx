Simplicity:</b> The model is straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for small projects with well-defined requirements.<br><b>2. Structured Phases:</b> Each phase has specific deliverables, which helps in clear documentation and project tracking.<br><b>3. Easy to Manage:</b> With clearly defined stages, project management and control are more straightforward.<br><b>4. Easy to Implement:</b> The model is simple to implement as it follows a sequential approach.<br><b>5. Ideal for Small Projects:</b> Works well for projects with clear requirements and minimal changes.<br><br> <b>Disadvantages:</b><br><b>1. Rigidity:</b> It is inflexible to changes once the project is underway, making it challenging to accommodate evolving requirements.<br><b>2. Late Testing:</b> Testing starts only after the development phase is complete, which may lead to late discovery of issues.<br><b>3. Not Ideal for Complex Projects:</b> Ineffective for large and complex projects where requirements are expected to evolve.<br><b>4. Assumes Requirements Are Well-Defined:</b> The model assumes that all requirements can be defined upfront, which may not be realistic for all projects.<br><b>5.
